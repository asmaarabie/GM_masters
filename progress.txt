============ April 20th 2015 ============
- Working version of the code
- Split the work between python code (for reading and quantizing) and matlab for recognition using kevin murphy's library
- Dataset: mapped_data_1430879228.mat
- Classes: 2; ‘Z’ and ‘tick’ 93% 16/16 as class 'tick' and 14/16 as class 'z'. 80 sample / class. 20% testing, 80% training
- Codebook: 20 
- HMM: Kevin murphy’s 8 states and 20 observations, discrete
- Preprocessing: no
- Segmentation: no
- When: 20th of April
- Result: accuracy 93% 16/16 as class 'tick' and 14/16 as class 'z'
============ April 3rd 2015 ============
- Working version of the code
- Not sure if it is correct
- Confusion matrix is messy --> each run produces a whole different output
- Reasons:
	- Random codebook per gesture
	- Random HMM settings (probability distribution out of baum-welch is random (doesn't converge to the same setting each time))
- Getting this error from the internals of viterbi: GHMM ghmm.py:148 - viterbi.c:ghmm_dmodel_viterbi(328): state_seq_index = -1, t = 40 --> mail ticket http://sourceforge.net/p/ghmm/mailman/message/26338592/
